## Chapter 8: Common Collections

Ownership adds an extra element to think about with collections. Vectors seem fairly normal aside from the extra thinking required with ownership. Maybe as a quick basic project I will implement a few sorting/search algorithms to get the feel for manipulating collections.

The end of the strings chapter sums it up nicely, they are not that simple. Strings in Rust are a lot more complicated than they are in a language like Python and 99% of its use cases.

### Pig Latin Translator

A simple program that takes a reference to a string and "translates" it into Pig Latin. This is a pretty good exercise in basic string manipulation and getting familiar with methods associated with the [String](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html) type.
