## Pig Latin Translator

At this point in the book, I wanted to write some Rust that isn't just from book examples so I made this Pig Latin translator. This is one of the projects suggested at the end of chapter 8 to learn about some common data types.

I decided to add a punctuation check but this function certainly doesn't cover all edge cases.
